# Forecasting SPY with LSTMs: Price Regression & Direction Classification

## üìå Project Summary
This project builds and evaluates **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks for forecasting the **SPY ETF** using historical OHLCV data and technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

Two complementary tasks are tackled:

1. **Regression ‚Äî Predicting the next-day closing price**
   - Evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
   - Compared against na√Øve and linear baselines.

2. **Classification ‚Äî Predicting the next-day market direction (up vs down)**
   - Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.
   - Compared against logistic regression and majority-class baselines.

The pipeline includes:
- Chronological data splitting (no leakage).
- Feature scaling with separate fit for train/test.
- 60-day rolling windows as input sequences.
- LSTM architectures tuned for each task.
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual prices and classification performance.

**Key Outcome**  
The models demonstrate that while LSTMs capture some temporal structure in SPY data, forecasting financial markets remains challenging‚Äîresults highlight the importance of rigorous baselines, leakage prevention, and careful evaluation.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Steps

- **Clean split (no leakage):** Scaler is fit only on training data, then applied to validation/test sets.  
- **Separate tracks:** Regression (predict price) and Classification (predict direction) are handled in distinct sections.  
- **Baselines:** Added na√Øve predictor for regression and logistic regression for classification.  
- **Evaluation plots:** Residuals histogram for regression, ROC curve and confusion matrix for classification ‚Äî all saved as PNGs in `/artifacts/`.  
- **README text printer:** Notebook generates Markdown-ready results and links for easy pasting into this README.  
- **Stretch (returns):** Experimental return-prediction pipeline included for more stable modeling.
